### LOG_2024

* I somehow managed not to keep logs longer than a single part of a single day and now it's been 10 years almost to the day I haven't kept logs here;
* I say *kept logs HERE* because I've been keeping countless logs elsewhere;
* As I wrote a lot about in my [__*General Workflow Folder*__](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS/GeneralWorkflow) (in the [*Methods Folder*](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS) in the [*Documentation Repository*](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation)), I keep what I call __*distributed logs*__ or __*ledgers*__ if you will, in numerous different places, online and offline;
* The basic idea is in *distributing the risk*, by adding a necessary __*REDUNDANCY*__ in the case of extreme failure;
* I've experienced too many failures in my life as an interdisciplinary artist-researcher that I have put certain processes and practices in place to mitigate them, if not outright help to prevent them in the first place;
* *Risk* is something I take very seriously and think about constantly; (There are also *Treats*, which are an entirely different thing, and I take care to mitigate and leasen the effects of those too, on my *Art Operation*);
* In any case, I will try to log some important things here in this *LOG Repository* at least in the coming months;
* I am constantly reworking and revamping all my workflow management methodologies, making them as __*RIGOROUS*__ and __*COMPREHENSIVE*__ as possible;
* It's forever a *Work in Progress*;

* I just came back from a nice, sizeable walk in the midday sun. It was grandiose. I had many great, profound experiences. I feel refreshed and reinvigorated;
* Ealier, befor my walk out to the cemetery and the park beside the library near the train tracks where I pondered longly, I published a new video of myself talking about my latest release of the *Cultural Software* that runs my *Art Operation* (SEE: [__THE HISTORIOTHEQUE OFFICIAL RELEASE v 4.2.0.__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7XK3AsD0IA);
* A few hours perhaps before this, I published the *Official Relase* on my Medium account (SEE: [__The Latest Official Release of The Historiotheque Semantic Version 4.2.0.__](https://medium.com/historiotheque/the-latest-official-release-of-the-historiotheque-semantic-version-4-2-0-216f21e93a91);
* I did other, *more clerical things*; I did however write a new piece called [__The Pilgrims and the Tourists: A Journey through the Art of Busyness and Contemplation__](https://medium.com/the-painters-almanach/the-pilgrims-and-the-tourists-a-journey-through-the-art-of-busyness-and-contemplation-c30cd577c8ba), which I think is very good;
* It's a topic that I've thought long and hard on and have also written about countless times; I find it however *a little too polemical for my taste*; I don't like scandal and controversy, but this a subject I've very well-versed in, am in a position to speak about authoritatively, and it IS scandalous and controversial; I made sure to include something in it saying that I wasn't trying to write a harangue or a tirade against what in the article I called "Tourists"; no, I said that the world NEEDED "Tourists"; probably no one will read it, and those that do, some will like it, others will be totally indifferent to its contents, and maybe a few will become passionately enraged; there's really nothing I can do about it, all I can do it write it and publish it; if, in any event, it rouses too much dispassion, I will just kindly remove it from publication;
* Last night, I watched the first episode in a *Limited Series* on Netflix called __*The Andy Warhol Diaries*__, which consists of excerpts from Andy Warhol's actual diaries, read by a robotic voice imitating his voice; it feels a little too robotic at times, but with the captivating images, it was a worthwhile thing to watch; I'm happy I watched it, I felt enriched by the experience; now I want to know more about Andy Warhol as a person and as an artist and entrepreneur; he says somewhere in what I saw that he saw art AS business; this idea fascinates me beyond mention; I will investigate it in the revival of an old project called the *Legal Tender Project*, where I played with the look & feel of old paper money in mixed media pieces I was creating, in the early 2000s when I lived in Montreal with my friend A.;
* I also, before finding out about the Netflix Series on him, read about the intriguing intersection between Warhol and religion, religious sentiment, contemplation, prayer, mystery itself; it seems he was even commissioned works by the Catholic Church; I had read a while back something about the *"secret life"* of Andy Warhol or something like that, I forget how the author put it; it appears he went to mass regularly over the course of many years, perhaps maybe the course of his life; I empathize deeply with this aspect of Andy Warhol that I was never really sure about, though I suspected there was something worth my while in investigating;
* That's it for now, I'm going to try to finish Soren Kierkegaard's __*"The Point of View of My Work as an Author"*__; it's quite warm out, a beautiful spring day, it inspires the spirit and warms the heart;
* *More to come...*
