### LOG_2024

10:38 2024-05-23

* I somehow managed not to keep logs longer than a single part of a single day and now it's been 8 years almost to the day I haven't kept logs here;
* I say *kept logs HERE* because I've been keeping countless logs elsewhere;
* As I wrote a lot about in my [__*General Workflow Folder*__](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS/GeneralWorkflow) (in the [*Methods Folder*](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS) in the [*Documentation Repository*](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation)), I keep what I call __*distributed logs*__ or __*ledgers*__ if you will, in numerous different places, online and offline;
* The basic idea is in *distributing the risk*, by adding a necessary __*REDUNDANCY*__ in the case of extreme failure;
* I've experienced too many failures in my life as an interdisciplinary artist-researcher that I have put certain processes and practices in place to mitigate them, if not outright help to prevent them in the first place;
* *Risk* is something I take very seriously and think about constantly; (There are also *Treats*, which are an entirely different thing, and I take care to mitigate and leasen the effects of those too, on my *Art Operation*);
* In any case, I will try to log some important things here in this *LOG Repository* at least in the coming months;
* I am constantly reworking and revamping all my workflow management methodologies, making them as __*RIGOROUS*__ and __*COMPREHENSIVE*__ as possible;
* It's forever a *Work in Progress*;
* *More to come...*
